        <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>¼ cup molasses</li>
                <li>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
                <li>1 ½ tablespoons ground ginger</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                <li>¾ tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>½ tablespoon ground cloves</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients. 
                    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                    Grease a cookie sheet.</li>
                <li>Combine sugar, eggs, oil, and molasses in a large bowl. 
                    Combine all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, ground ginger, 
                    baking powder, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, and ground 
                    nutmeg in a separate bowl; stir into sugar mixture until a 
                    stiff dough forms.</li>
                <li>Divide dough in half; shape each into a roll the length of the
                     cookie sheet. Place rolls on the prepared cookie sheet; pat 
                     down to flatten dough until ½-inch thick.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
                <li>When cool enough to touch, cut into ½-inch thick diagonal slices.</li>
                <li>Place sliced biscotti on the cookie sheet; bake until toasted and 
                    crispy, 5 to 7 minutes on each side.</li>
            </ol>
