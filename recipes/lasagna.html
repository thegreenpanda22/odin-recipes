            garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>

             tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>

             and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasoning:</strong>This lasagna recipe is flavored with

            lasagna extra decadent.</li>
